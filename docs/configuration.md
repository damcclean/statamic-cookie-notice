During installation, you'll publish a configuration file for Cookie Notice to `config/cookie-notice.php`. The contents of said file look like this:

```php
<?php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Cookie
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | It's ironic, but this addon uses cookies to store if a user has consented
    | to cookies or not, and which ones they've consented to. Don't worry
    | though, no cookie is stored if the user doesn't consent.
    |
    */

    'cookie_name' => 'COOKIE_NOTICE',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Consent Groups
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Consent groups allow you to give your users the option to which cookies they'd
    | like to enable and which cookies they'd prefer to keep disabled.
    |
    */

    'groups' => [
        'Necessary' => [
            'required' => true,
            'toggle_by_default' => true,
        ],
        'Statistics' => [
            'required' => false,
            'toggle_by_default' => false,
        ],
        'Marketing' => [
            'required' => false,
            'toggle_by_default' => false,
        ],
    ],

];
```

- `cookie_name` defines the name of the cookie you wish to store the users' cookie preferences.
- `groups` is an array of consent groups. Feel free to update them however you want. The key is the name of the group, which will be displayed to the user. `required` defines whether the user is absolutly required to accept cookies for that group. `toggle_by_default` will automatically check the checkbox on the consent notice, however the user will be able to uncheck it if they want.
